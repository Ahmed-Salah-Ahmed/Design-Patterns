 Head First Design Patterns Book Samples

1) The Strategy Pattern:
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that
use it.

2) The Observer Pattern:
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between a set of objects . When the state of one object changes , all of its dependents are notified.
The subject is the sole owner of that data, the observers are dependent on the subject to update them when the data changes. This Leads to a cleaner OO design than allowing many objects to control the same data.
Observer Pattern is a great example of loose coupling. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
